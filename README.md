# Algebraic Optics

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/rahulmutt/algebraic-optics.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/rahulmutt/algebraic-optics)

This library implements generalized optics that work for both immutable and mutable data structures. 
It follows the core ideas from the paper *Towards Optic-Based Algebraic Theories: the Case of Lenses* by J. López-González and Juan M. Serrano and extends them to the polymorphic case.

See the [stateless](https://github.com/hablapps/stateless) library in Scala for the original implementation.

## Usage

See the examples in the [test suite](./test/Test.hs) for examples.
